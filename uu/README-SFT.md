Prerequisite: gcc >=8.5.0; cuda_11.3.0; cudnn v8.2.0;


1) Get source code
git clone --recursive â€¦ cc-ae.
cd cc-ae
git submodule sync
git submodule update --init --recursive

2) Create a conda virtual environment and dependencies
conda install numpy ninja pyyaml mkl mkl-include setuptools cmake cffi typing_extensions future six requests dataclasses
conda install psutil

3) Build Pytorch from source code:
python setup.py develop

4) Set environment to use uu package:
export UU=$your folder path..$/cc-ae   
export PYTHONPATH=$UU

You have to build the code with cuda and cudnn enabled. We currently do not support cpu or no-cudnn operators.

5) Here is the code structure:
uu/benchmarking := It contains all benckmarks python files and bash script to generate data for plotting fig 8 in paper;
                   It has 2 CNN networks and comparison codes(default pytorch and pytorch-checkpoint); 
                   It also has 2 correctness check python files to ensure that our work(SFT) produces exact same output tensor after forward pass and gradient tensors after backpropogation for each conv2d layers.
uu/layers := Our customized operators.
uu/utils := Some dependencies file of SFT.

6) How to extend SFT to other models:
I use "vgg-16-our.py" as an exmaple template to explain how we implemnt SFT to a CNN network.
